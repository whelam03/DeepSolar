# DeepSolar

For this assignment the goal was to build a supervised learning model to predict if a tile can be considered as containing low-to-medium or high solar power system coverage, using the available social, economic, housing, geographical, and meteorological features in the Deep Solar Dataset.

Implemented a total of 4 models while making an error in the first 3 correcting my error in the last one making some adjustments to optimise
